# **Learn Together Algorithm p.1**

### **Introduction**
This is a new blog post series about algorithms. I'm new to this topic, and I want to learn together with you, and of course, pass my next exam in university. :)

# Algorithms:
- **Definition:** A set of ordered elementary operations that are unambiguous and computable, so that when we run it with a specific input, we get a specific output and stop in a finite time.

### Key Points of the Algorithm:
1. **Ordered operations** -> The operations must be in a specific, clear order.
2. **No ambiguity** -> The operations must be clear and unambiguous.
3. **Computable** -> The operations must be computable.
4. **Finiteness** -> A finite number of operations, a finite number of inputs, and completion in a finite time.

### Resolution Process:
1. **Analyze the computational problem** -> What input do we start with? What output do we want? What are the constraints? Desired properties?
2. **Design the algorithm** -> Find an approach to solve the problem and write it in natural language or use a flowchart.
3. **Implement the algorithm** -> Use a programming language.
4. **Test the algorithm** -> Test the algorithm with different inputs; if the output is not as expected, we need to go back to step 2.

### Desired Properties:
1. **Correctness** -> All instances should complete with the correct output.
2. **Generality** -> The algorithm should be applicable to a specific group of problems.
3. **Determinism** -> If we take the same input, we should get the same output.
4. **Efficiency** -> The algorithm should be efficient in terms of cost.

## Structured Programming:
- **Definition:** A programming paradigm that allows writing programs in a structured way.

- **Key Points:**
  1. **Sequence** -> The operations are executed in a specific order.
  2. **Selection** -> The operations are executed only if a specific condition is true.
  3. **Repetition** -> The operations are executed multiple times.

### Useful for Writing the Algorithm in a Structured Way.

## **Introduction to Computational Thinking**

**Computational thinking** is a problem-solving process that relies on several key principles. These allow problems to be formulated in a way that enables a computer to solve them:

1. **Problem formulation**: Representing problems in a form that allows the use of a computer to solve them.
2. **Logical organization of data**: Representing information through encoding, data structures, and efficient processes.
3. **Abstraction and modeling**: The ability to ignore irrelevant details and focus on the most important aspects of the problem.
4. **Problem decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems (a "divide and conquer" approach).
5. **Pattern recognition**: The ability to identify recurring structures.
6. **Inductive and deductive reasoning**: The ability to extract general rules from specific examples and draw conclusions from given premises.
7. **Algorithms**: The concept of well-defined procedures to achieve results from given inputs.
8. **Automation**: The idea that systems can control processes automatically.
9. **Interaction and testing**: The ability to interact with devices and verify their functionality.
10. **Causality (cause-effect relationships)**: The idea that actions lead to corresponding effects.
