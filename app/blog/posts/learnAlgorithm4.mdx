## **Complexity of Recursive Functions**:

from a program we can calucale it's complexity by counting the sum of the contributions,
but for recursive functions it's a bit more complex, because we need to account for the cost of the recursive call itself.

## Major Families of Techniques for resolving Recurrence:

1. **Iterative Method:**  
   The equation is expanded step by step until a closed-form expression (a function of _n_ and constants) is determined.

2. **Substitution Method:**  
   An estimated bound (e.g., O(nÂ²)) is assumed, then mathematical induction is used to verify the guess.

3. **Recursion Tree Method:**  
   A recursion tree is constructed, where the nodes represent the costs at various levels of recursion.  
   We saw an example of this tree in the Fibonacci case.

   - It can help in formulating a good "guess" for the substitution method.

4. **Master Theorem Method:**  
   Based on the Master Theorem, useful for divide-and-conquer algorithms of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n).
